Hi everyone Larry here,
I enjoy web developement, scripting and many programming languages as a software engineer. 
# Restrict_Ethernet_Conn
Restrict network connection based on ip address by detecting ethernet cable and shutdown computer for unwanted connection. Does not matter if user is logged in or not.  Code for Windows &amp; Mac
# Why would you want to do this?
I'm sure you have your own reason(s), personally I had a security issue involving an application called LogMeIn being in the hands of a mad man network administrator.  So I moved my Windows & Mac computer to a different network where I have control.  I had to find a way to prevent my computers from temporarilly being moved to the offending network where unspeakable things could happen.
